Our hope is that by presenting ads tailored to your interests, we will enhance your experience across the iEstates Network&#39;s diverse websites.<br />\r\n\tFor example, if you often visit content on the iEstates Network about travel, we may use &quot;web beacons&quot; to infer your possible interest in travel and may deliver an ad to you related to that interest. It&#39;s important to understand that these technologies do not use personally identifiable information to make this happen but instead use anonymous identifiers within the &quot;cookies&quot; stored in your browser.
